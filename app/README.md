# Google Maps: My Bike Tours

With this app you can make custom markers on a map. In markers.json all the markers are being stored. See below how to modify this file. This particular application has all my routes, marker images and other data necessary for this application.

## Modifying markers.json

markers.json is an array of markers. Each marker is made like this:

```javascript
{
  "title": "",
  "location": {
    "lat": 52.189941,
    "lng": 4.442889
  },
  "description": "",
  "date": "",
  "icon": "",
  "line": ""
}
```
